metadata:
  name: example-role
spec:
(!docs/pages/includes/roles_config.yaml!)
```

## YAML Table

| Attribute | Parent Field | Required | Description | Default Value | Accepted Values |
| --- | --- |  --- | --- |  --- | --- |
| kind | | | | |
| version | | | | |
| metadata | | | | |
| name | metadata | | | |

## Example Role impersonation YAML

Two roles can be combined into one YAML file. 

The example below shows on role that [impersonates](../../access-controls/guides/impersonation.mdx) the other.

```yaml
# role-impersonation.yaml

kind: role
version: v3
metadata:
  name: testrole
spec:
  allow:
    logins: ['access']
---
kind: role
version: v3
metadata:
  name: imperole
spec:
  allow:
    impersonate:
      roles: ['testrole']
```

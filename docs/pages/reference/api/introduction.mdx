title: Teleport API Introduction
description: Introduction to the Teleport gRPC API.
---

The Teleport Auth API provides a gRPC API for remotely interacting with a Teleport Auth server.

Teleport has a public [Go client](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gravitational/teleport/api/client)
to programatically interact with the API. [tsh and tctl](../../reference/cli-docs.mdx) use the same API.

## Go client

Here is what you can do with the Go Client:
 - Integrating with external tools, which we have already done 
   for [several tools](../../enterprise/workflow/index.mdx#integrating-with-an-external-tool),
   such as Slack, Jira, and Mattermost.
 - Writing a program/bot to manage access requests automatically, based on your use case. One idea
   is to allow/deny developer requests based on their currently assigned tasks.
 - Performing CRUD actions on resources, such as `roles`, `auth connectors`, and `provisioning tokens`.
 - Dynamically configuring Teleport.

  Not all endpoints are supported by the new public API client yet. See this 
  [github issue](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/6394).

  We are currently working on improving our API and its documentation. If you have an API suggestion,

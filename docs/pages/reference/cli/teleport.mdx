The Teleport daemon is called `teleport`. It can be configured to run one or
more "roles" with the `--roles` flags. The arguments to `--roles` correspond to
the following services.

| Service | Role Name | Description |
| - | - | - |
| [Node](../../architecture/nodes.mdx) | `node` | Runs a daemon on a node which allows SSH connections from authenticated clients. |
| [Auth](../../architecture/authentication.mdx) | `auth` | Authenticates nodes and users who want access to Teleport Nodes or information about the cluster. |
| [Proxy](../../architecture/proxy.mdx) | `proxy` | The gateway that clients use to connect to the Auth or Node Services. |
| [App](../../application-access/introduction.mdx) | `app` | Runs a daemon on a node which provides access to applications using an SSH reverse tunnel. |
| [Kube](../../kubernetes-access/introduction.mdx) | `kube` | Runs the Teleport node as a kubernetes access server. |
| [DB](../../database-access/reference.mdx) | `db` | Indicates that the Teleport node should be run as a database access server. |
| [Trusted Cluster](../../trustedclusters.mdx) | `trusted_cluster` | The node will support a leaf cluster used to connect to another Teleport cluster. |

### teleport start

#### Flags

| Name | Default Value(s) | Allowed Value(s) | Description |
| - | - | - | - |
| `-d, --debug` | none | none | enable verbose logging to stderr |
| `--insecure-no-tls` | `false` | `true` or `false` | Tells proxy to not generate default self-signed TLS certificates. This is useful when running Teleport on kubernetes (behind reverse proxy) or behind things like AWS ELBs, GCP LBs or Azure Load Balancers where SSL termination is provided externally. |
| `-r, --roles` | `proxy,node,auth` | **string** comma-separated list of `proxy, node` or `auth` | start listed services/roles. These roles are explained in the [Teleport Architecture](../../architecture/overview.mdx) document. |
| `--pid-file` | none | **string** filepath | create a PID file at the path |
| `--advertise-ip` | none | **string** IP | advertise IP to clients, often used behind NAT |
| `-l, --listen-ip` | `0.0.0.0` | [**net. IP**](https://golang.org/pkg/net/#IP) | binds services to IP |
| `--auth-server` | none | **string** IP | proxy attempts to connect to a specified auth server instead of local auth, disables `--roles=auth` if set |
| `--token` | none | **string** | set invitation token to register with an auth server on start, used once and ignored afterwards. Obtain it by running `tctl nodes add` on the auth server.*We recommend to use tools like `pwgen` to generate sufficiently random tokens of 32+ byte length.* |
| `--ca-pin` | none | **string** `sha256:<hash>` | set CA pin to validate the Auth Server. Generated by `tctl status` |
| `--nodename` | `hostname` command on the machine | **string** | assigns an alternative name for the node which can be used by clients to login. By default it's equal to the value returned by |
| `-c, --config` | `/etc/teleport.yaml` | **string** `.yaml` filepath | starts services with config specified in the YAML file, overrides CLI flags if set |
| `--bootstrap` | none | **string** `.yaml` filepath | bootstrap configured YAML resources {/* TODO link how to configure this file */} |
| `--labels` | none | **string** comma-separated list | assigns a set of labels to a node, for example env=dev,app=web. See the explanation of labeling mechanism in the [Labeling Nodes](../../admin-guide.mdx#labeling-nodes-and-applications) section. |
| `--insecure` | none | none | disable certificate validation on Proxy Service, validation still occurs on Auth Service. |
| `--fips` | none | none | start Teleport in FedRAMP/FIPS 140-2 mode. |
| `--diag-addr` | none | none | Enable diagnostic endpoints |
| `--permit-user-env` | none | none | flag reads in environment variables from `~/.tsh/environment` when creating a session. |
| `--app-name` | none | none | Name of the application to start |
| `--app-uri` | none | none | Internal address of the application to proxy |
| `--app-public-addr` | none | none | Public address fo the application to proxy |

#### Examples

```
# By default without any configuration, teleport starts running as a single-node
# cluster. It's the equivalent of running with --roles=node,proxy,auth
sudo teleport start

# Starts a node named 'db' running in strictly SSH mode role, joining the cluster
# serviced by the auth server running on 10.1.0.1
sudo teleport start --roles=node --auth-server=10.1.0.1 --token=xyz --nodename=db

# Same as the above, but the node runs with db=master label and can be connected
# to using that label in addition to its name.
sudo teleport start --roles=node --auth-server=10.1.0.1 --labels=db=master

# Starts an app server that proxies the application "example-app" running at http://localhost:8080.
sudo teleport start --roles=app --token=xyz --auth-server=proxy.example.com:3080 \
    --app-name="example-app" \
    --app-uri="http://localhost:8080" \
    --labels=group=dev
```

### teleport status

Shows the status of a Teleport connection:

```bash
teleport status
```

This command is only available from inside of a recorded SSH session.

### teleport configure

Dumps a **sample** configuration file in YAML format into
standard output:

```bash
teleport configure
```

<Admonition title="warning" type="Warning">
  **Caution**: This sample config is *not* the default config and should be used
for reference only. 

  View [Config Reference](../../config-reference.mdx) for all YAML configuration options.
</Admonition>

### teleport version

Shows the release version:

```bash
teleport version
```

### teleport help

Displays help options for `teleport`:

```bash
teleport help
```

And, for its subcommands:

```bash
teleport help <subcommand>
```
